            <p id="img-caption">Aristotle made large contributions to bodies of knowledge with regards to Physics, Astronomy, Geology, Psychology, and of course, Philosophy. His founded school, the Lyseum, would teach students across all of these areas of knowledge as well as Medicine, Mathematics, Music, Art, Theology, Politics, and the many sub-disciplines across each subject. Often when discussing Aristotle or his works, it can often go overlooked about the contibution he had in kicking off the start of the Hellenistic period. With strong ties to the areas around Macedon, Athens, and kingdoms along the western border of the Persian empire, he played a critical role in the education and communication of key antiquity players of his time.</p>

            <h3>A Brief Overview</h3>

            <p></p>

            <ul>

                <li>384 BC - Aristotle was born in 384 BC at Stagira, Chalcidice (Northern Greece). His father Nicomachus was the personal physician to the King of Macedon at that time, King Amyntas. Aristotle's name meant 'The Best Purpose'.</li>

                <li>384 to ~365 BC - Although few details survived in writings about his childhood, it is assumed that he was able to make many important connections with, and through, the Macedonian monarchy.</li>

                <li>~365 to ~347 BC - In his late teens he moved to Athens to attend Plato's Academy, and would stay in Athens for two decades.</li>

                <li>348 / 347 BC - It is thought that two reasons may have contributed to his leaving Athens – the first being control over the Acamdey being passed to Plato's nephew Speusippus upon Plato's death, but the second being that he feared anti-Macedonian sentiment prevalent in Athens. Upon leaving Athens, he would accompany fellow philosopher Xenocrates under the patronage of Hermeias of Atarneus to the Assos/Lesbos region. This is also believed to have been a diplomatic mission of sorts at the urging from Phillip II of Macedon.</li>

                <li>345 / 344 BC - Aristotle moved to Mytilene on Lesbos with fellow philosopher Theophratus. On Lesbos, they would conduct much research on botany and zoology. During his time with his host Hermeias of Atarneus while in Assos/Lesbos, Aristotle would marry Hermeias's daughter or niece, Pythias. They would have a girl, also naming her Pythias.</li>

                <li>~343 BC - The Persian empire successfully captures Hermias, tortures, and then kills him. After his death, Aristotle would accept an invitation from Phillip II of Macedon to tutor his son Alexander. It would be a Great opportunity. Becoming the head of the royal academy of Macedon, Aristotle would not only give lessons to Alexander, but also to other important figures and kings: including Ptolemy and Cassander. He would advise Alexander on conquest and expansion for the eastern frontiers.</li>

                <li>335 BC - Aristotle returned to Athens and established the Lyceum, his own school, which he would manage for over a decade. His wife Pythias would pass, and he would later become involved with Herpyllis of Stagira. Herpyllis would bear him a son named after his father, Nicomachus.</li>

                <li>322 BC - After Alexander's death Aristotle was denounced for impiety, and he fled to his mother's family estate. Later in 322 BC, Aristotle died of natural causes in Chalcis, Euboea.</li>
