                        <!-- Early Life x5 -->
                        <li>384 BC - Born in 384 BC, at Stagira, Chalcidice (Northern Greece) - His name means 'The Best Purpose'. His father Nicomachus was the personal physician to the King of Macedon at that time, King Amyntas</li>
                        <li>384 - ~365 BC Although few details survived in writings about his childhood, it is assumed that he was able to make many important connections with and through the Macedonian monarchy.</li>
                        <li>~365 - ~347 BC In his late teens, he moved to Athens to attend Plato's Academy, and would stay in Athens for two decades.</li>
                        <li>347 / 348 BC It is thought that two reasons may have contributed to his leaving – the first being control over the Acamdey being passed to Plato's nephew Speusippus upon Plato's death, but also that he feared anti-Macedonian sentiment prevalent in Athens.</li>

                        <!-- Mid Life x5 -->
                        <li>Upon leaving Athens, he would accompany fellow philosopher Xenocrates under the patronage of Hermias of Atarneus to the Assos/Lesbos region. This is also believed to have been a diplomatic mission of sorts at urging from Phillip II of Macedon</li>
                        <li>~345 / 344 Moved to Mytilene on Lesbos with fellow philosopher Theophratus. On Lesbos, they would conduct much research on botany and zoology on the island.</li>
                        <li>During his time with Hermias of Atarneus while in Assos/Lesbos, Aristotle wuld marry his daughter or niece Pythias. They would have a girl, also named Pythias. </li>
                        <li>343 BC The Persian empire successfully captures Hermias, tortures, and then kills him. After his death, Aristotle would accept an invitation from Phillip II of Macedon to tutor his son Alexander. It would be a Great opportunity.</li>
                        <li>Becoming the head of the royal academy of Macedon, Aristotle would not only give lessons to Alexander, but also to other important figures and kings: including Ptolemy and Cassander. He would advise Alexander on conquest and expansion on the eastern frontiers.</li>

                        <!-- Late Life x5 -->
                        <li>335 BC Aristotle had returned to Athens and established the Lyceum, his own school which he would manage for over a decade. Pythias would pass, and he would become involved with Herpyllis of Stagira, who bore him a son named after his father Nicomachus, and possibly an eromenos, Palaephatus of Abydus</li>
                        <li>335 – 323 BC is when Aristotle is to have thought to have composed many of his works, including... [][][][]</li>
                        <li>322 Aristotle was denounced for impiety, he fled to his mother's family estate. Died in 322 BC, at Euboea, Greece</li>

                        <br>

                        <li>Aristotle is one of the major figureheads in Western civilization, one of the greatest advocates for logic, reason, and empiricism.</li>
                        <li>Contributed to many subjects, including: physics, biology, zoology, metaphysics, logic, ethics, aesthetics, poetry, theater, music, rhetoric, linguistics, politics, and government.</li>
                        <li>In addition to his encyclopedic research, writings, and teaching, he had a huge impact upon geo-politic events with the Macdeonian Kings.</li>
